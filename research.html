      <h2>MATH IS POETRY. PHYSICS IS POETRY IN MOTION.</h2>
      <p><strong>ON RESEARCH:</strong> A strong need to stand out after losing my LinkedIn page inspired a chance to focus on a recently learned math problem that is yet to be solved.</p>
      <p><strong>GOAL:</strong> Provide a novel perspective or framing of the problem that I could offer as work/analysis/ingenuity for job searching.</p>
      <p>I never expected this development.</p>
      <p>I love how basic math theory works, looking at numbers, trying to understand fundamentally how they tie to our existence. A part of my process includes examining and testing what might seem outside usual rationale.</p>
      <p>These papers are currently unpublished. Submissions have been made to reputable archives. Public drafts and source materials are provided below for independent review and reference.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> I have not been funded, and I am not monetizing from these efforts. This includes this website.</p>
      <p><em>Author's Note:</em> Enthusiasm is no substitute for advanced education or professional experience. These ideas come from a lifetime of interest and contemplation with respect for institutional scholarship.</p>

      <h3>Subject: Collatz Conjecture</h3>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Self-Similar and Scaling Fractals in the domain of Real numbers (Preprint)</p>
